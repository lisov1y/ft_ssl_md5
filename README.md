MD5 is a cryptographic hash function. It is short for "Message Digest 5". It has found to contain several vulnerabilities, but can still be safely used as a checksum to verify data integrity against unintentional corruption.

SHA-256 is one of the functions in the SHA (Secure Hash Algorithms) family. The SHA
algorithms were designed by the NSA. SHA-512 is currently used in part of the process
to authenticate Debian software packages.
